### Hi there 👋, I'm Ram

- :zap: I'm currently a ML Architect at AWS on the Amazon SageMaker team. I graduated in 2021 from the University of Virginia with a Bachelor's degree in Statistics and am currently pursuing my Master's in Computer Information & Technology at the University of Pennsylvania. I have an interest in building Full-Stack ML/AI solutions at scale in the cloud.
- :earth_africa: I love writing and teaching about interesting technical topics in my free time. Feel free to check out my latest [article](https://towardsdatascience.com/load-testing-llmperf/) and [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz8eBA5Pu7M).
